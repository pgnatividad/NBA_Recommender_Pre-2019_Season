## <u>Executive Summary</u>
In this project I created a recommender system that takes in a basketball player and lists down the 10 most similar players. I intended this script to be used for fantasy basketball drafting. In fantasy the player of choice could already be taken, so I wanted a script that can recommend only players that are available. I wanted to solve the question "My favorite player got picked, who should I draft in his place?"  I created this recommender using data from BasketballReference.com. After scraping the data I created the recommender using the library pairwise distances. I then created the script so I can use input/output to search players and to remove players.
